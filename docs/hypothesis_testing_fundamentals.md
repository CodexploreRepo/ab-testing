# Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals

## Hypothesis Tests in A/B Testing Use-cases

- **Example 1**:
  - In 2013, Electronic Arts, or EA, launched a video game called SimCity 5. Leading up to its release, they wanted to increase pre-order sales.
  - _Hypothesis_: "showing an ads would increase sales"
  - The **control** group: was shown the version with a banner advertising money off their next purchase with each pre-order. (with ads)
  - The **treatment** group: saw the version without the ad banner. (without ads)
  - EA compared the **percentage of checkouts** for the two groups to see which performed best.
  - Result:
    - The results of the A/B test were surprising.
    - The treatment page without the advertisement resulted in 43 percent higher sales than the control page with the advert.
    - The experiment proved that our intuition that "more discount adverts would result in more sales" was FALSE.

- **Example 2**: Stack-overflow survey about Data Scientist Salaries
  - _Hypothesis_: "the mean annual compensation of the population of data scientists is 110,000 dollars"
